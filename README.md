# 💰 Financial Data Analysis with Power BI and Pandas

This project presents an in-depth analysis of personal spending using both **Power BI** and **Python (Pandas)**. By exploring transaction data across time, categories, and behaviors, the project delivers powerful insights with a dual-approach: a **coded exploratory notebook** and a **professional dashboard**.

## 📊 Pandas Analysis (Notebook)

- Extracted features like `hour`, `day`, `month`
- Grouped and aggregated transactions using
- Created bar plots for time-based spending patterns
- Identified average and peak spending behavior
- Prepared clean data for dashboard integration
